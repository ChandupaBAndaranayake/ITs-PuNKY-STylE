**Digit Separator and Counter**
- This program takes an integer input from the user and performs two main tasks:
    - Counting Digits: It calculates and displays the number of digits in the input number.
    - Digit Separation: It separates each digit of the input number and prints them individually.

**How to Use:**

1. Compile the Program:
    - Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC for Linux or MinGW for Windows).
    - Compile the program using the following command:
        `gcc program_name.c -o program_name`
    - Replace program_name.c with the actual filename of your C code and program_name with the desired executable name.

2. Run the Program:
    - Execute the compiled program:
        `./program_name`
    - Follow the prompts to enter an integer number when prompted.

3. Output:
    - The program will display the number of digits in the entered number.
    - It will then print each digit of the number on a separate line
